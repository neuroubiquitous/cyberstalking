Avoid Being a Victim of Cyber Crime: Follow These 5 Tips

1. If it sounds too good to be true it probably is. I know this sounds obvious, but if youâ€™re in a tough place or even if your just distracted enough it is very easy to let your guard down.

2. Check your annual credit report at annualcreditreport.com if there have been suspicious actions this is one of your best chances to find them.

3. Do not post your full birthday (including adding your DOB on your social media profiles such as Instagram and Facebook) or social security number online.

4. Have a plan for responding to potential theft such as a backup card that is unused so you can easily cancel the other one.
